        <h2>My favorite team sport is basketball<h2></h2>
        <p>It is my favorite team sport because I like being able to dribble a ball around, doing different <b>tricks</b>, 
            spinning it on my finger, etc. And it's is always so satisfying sinking a basket. Hearing the swish of the basket 
            after a shot you took is just so <b>rewarding</b>, no matter who you are. It also is a great way to practice hand eye 
            coordination because being able to do things unpredictably or without looking is very important in that sport.</p>
